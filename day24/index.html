                <h2>The Story Of The Birth Of Jesus</h2>
                <p>
                    A young woman named Mary lives in a town called Nazareth and is engaged to a man named Joseph. One night, God sent an angel named Gabriel to visit Mary. The angel told Mary: “God is very pleased with you and you will soon become pregnant and have a baby boy. Name him Jesus because he will be God’s own son. “Mary is scared but believes in God and believes everything will be fine. The angel tells Mary to live with her cousin Elizabeth and her husband Zachariah as they will soon become the parents of a child that will pave the way for Jesus. Mary lived with her cousin for three months and then returned to Nazareth.

                    Meanwhile, Joseph is worried about Mary giving birth before they get married, but an angel appears in his dream and tells him that Mary will give birth to a Son of God. He also told him not to fear and to make Mary his legal wife. Jesus Christ means that the Savior and the baby will truly be a savior for His people. Joseph wakes up from his dream and the next day Joseph and Mary get married.

                    Some time later, Joseph and Mary had to travel to Bethlehem, a long way from Nazareth. Mary’s babies are about to be born and so they are very slow. When they arrived in Bethlehem, they had no room to live in because all the inns and rooms were occupied. The couple was in the barn, a goat and a horse, and on the very night Jesus was born. Jesus is placed in a manger (feeding place) after birth and wrapped in a cloth.

                    On the outskirts of Bethlehem, their shepherds saw an angel appear before them. The angel said to them: “Your messiah was born in Bethlehem today. He is lying in the manger ”. When the shepherds ran back to find Joseph, Mary, and Jesus in the barn, they were surprised and happy.

                    At the time of Jesus’ birth, a new bright star appeared in the sky. There were three wise men in a distant country who knew that Jesus’ appearance was a sign of the arrival of a great king and they rushed to find him. King Herod heard that the wise men were looking for the great new king, whom he knew would replace him. King Herod planned to kill the baby, but no one knew about it yet.

                    The three sages follow the shining star until they reach the barn, where the family is happy. They bathed Him with gifts and worshiped the Son of God. They also knew that the king was wicked and therefore did not inform him of the location where the child Jesus was located. Joseph was warned by an angel in his dream that Herod would seek Jesus to kill him, so they’d better go to Egypt. This is where they lived until the demon king’s death. Because Jesus cannot be found, Herod has ordered the killing of all the children in Bethlehem.
